        <p><center>thanks to all of you for making my osu! experience amazing!</center></p>
        <p>there are many people not mentioned here yet, but it's a start! some of these are out-of-order, and others are missing links, but just ignore that for now. I'll be updating this list whenever I feel that it's getting outdated (that'll likely become an excuse to let it go untouched for years).</p>
